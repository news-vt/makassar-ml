    - Proposes a novel Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN) that predicts crop yield using the features:
      - yield information (g/m2 )
      - CO2 concentration (mmp)
      - temperature (◦C)
      - humidity deficit (g/kg)
      - relative humidity (percentage)
      - radiation (W/m2)
